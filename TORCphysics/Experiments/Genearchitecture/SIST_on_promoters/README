Run sequence_generator.py to generate the 3 sequences with flanking G's:
python sequence_generator.py

Move each sequence to their respective directory, e.g., weak/SIST_code
And in SIST_code, rename it as input.fasta.

Run all *sh files!

Go to filtering, and run all *sh again.

Then go to plots, plot heatmaps, and then fit the sigmoid functions!

Or run the python scripts here to analyse energy profiles and the fits.
