The data collected here is from the paper:
Assessing in vivo the impact of gene context on transcription through DNA supercoiling

With authors: Ihab Boulas, Lisa Bruno, Sylvie Rimsky, Olivier Espeli, Ivan Junier, Olivier Rivoire

For the experimental data (weak.csv, medium.csv, strong.csv), I collected it from their data that they uploaded to
github (in the Notebook folder).
