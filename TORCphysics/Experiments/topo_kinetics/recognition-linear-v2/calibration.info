Hello, this is the info file for the calibration of Topo I and Gyrase Models.
Topo I Binding Model = TopoIRecognition
Topo I Effect Model = TopoILinear
Topo I Unbinding Model = PoissonUnBinding
Gyrase Binding Model = GyraseRecognition
Gyrase Effect Model = GyraseLinear
Gyrase Unbinding Model = PoissonUnBinding
Ran 4 simulations per test. 
Number of tests = 10
