Here, we want to calibrate using the same Linear effect model but with a couple of changes.

Calibration method:
* Models will be calibrated just using a particular substrate concentration [S], and the code will be independent of this
  variable
* Models will be calibrated using a reference concentration c0: k = k_cat * F(superhelical) * c / c0

TopoI:
* Binding model = Poisson binding
* Effect model = Linear effect
* Unbinding model = Poisson unbinding

Gyrase:
* Binding model = Recognition
* Effect model = Linear effect
* Unbinding model = Poisson unbinding
