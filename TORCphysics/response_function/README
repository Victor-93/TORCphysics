in disc-10_sequence.txt I prepare the sequences for creating the fasta files...
I also added some info in there...

I will explore this free energy of melting when considering the 14bp of sequence (-10+discriminator) as done in
2019HoudaigiNAR, and the case where I consider the sequence of the 39bps that correspond the -30, spacer, -10, discriminator

I think the case of the 39bp makes more sense to me because the promoter is always going to be present...
So there's no point in isolating the 14bp region? We'll see once I plot the curves:

I will run it for the 14bp sequence...

Benham_code/ - Runs SIDD on the discriminator sequence, where the 14bp.fasta file is the input.

filtering/   - process results from SIDD for plotting

plots/       - plots the SIDD profiles and calculates the fitting for the openning energy.

So first go to Benham_code/ run the bash file, then go to filtering/ to process results, and then to 
plot/ to fit the curves and obtain the curve parametrization
