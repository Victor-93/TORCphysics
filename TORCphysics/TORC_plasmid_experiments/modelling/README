Here, I will run TORCPhysics trying to find parametrisation that can reproduce and explain experimental results.

In this folder, I will put all the parametrization, e.g. topoI, gyrase, RNAP parametrizations.

In optimization/ I'll have the actual code that runs the calibration, the circuit files and environmental files.
