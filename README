v1/ - It uses a sigmoid curve for describing the rate function. It is parametrised
      by the shape of the sigmoid, and its maximums/minimum rates.
    - I also add new inputs to better describe/simulate the system...
    - These new inputs correspond to:
      * genome.csv:     gives global information about system
      * genes.csv:      information about genes:
      * objects.csv:    info about enzymes bound to DNA
      * enviroment.csv: info about enviromental signals/enzymes that may affect the
                        system's state, these enzymes can be topos, ATP, LACI concentration, etc..
